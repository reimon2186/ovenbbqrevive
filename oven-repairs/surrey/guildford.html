                        <p> 
                            If a specific part is required and is not immediately available, we will source it through trusted suppliers and arrange a return visit to fit it. We keep you informed throughout the process so you know what to expect. You will never be charged multiple service fees for the same repair, and no work goes ahead without your approval. Our aim is to complete the repair correctly using suitable components.

                        <p> 
                            We carry out repairs on electric ovens commonly found in residential homes. Our experience covers a wide range of brands and designs, including built-in units, double ovens, and larger range-style appliances. If you are unsure whether your oven falls within our scope, you are welcome to get in touch and we can advise before booking.

                        <p> 
                            Repair times vary depending on the fault and the work required. Some repairs can be completed in around forty minutes, while others may take a few hours if multiple components are involved. We always focus on completing the repair properly rather than rushing, and we will give you a clear idea of what to expect once the issue has been assessed.
