                <p class="intro-text">
                    Keeping an oven in good condition makes day-to-day cooking far easier, and plenty of households in Yateley call on Oven & BBQ Revive when theirs starts to feel tired or slow to heat. Some people book in after noticing smoke or lingering smells, while others simply like having their appliance brought back to a clean, efficient state without the hassle of doing it themselves. We use safe, non-toxic products during the indoor part of the clean and work steadily through the build-up that forms over months of use. When we’re done, the oven runs more reliably and looks noticeably brighter, giving you a fresher kitchen and a smoother cooking experience.

By working carefully through the interior, we help your appliance cook more reliably and look far fresher inside.

                                     <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Your oven refresh begins the moment you get in touch for a free, no-obligation quote based on your appliance and its condition. Once you are happy with the estimate, we arrange an appointment that suits your schedule. On the day, we give you a quick call before we arrive to keep everything running smoothly.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        When we arrive, our technician carries out a full inspection of your oven and removes all detachable parts such as racks, and doors. These are placed into our heated dip tank to break down heavy grease and burnt-on residue while we prepare the main oven for cleaning.
                                    </p>

                                    With the removable parts soaking, we focus on the oven interior. Each surface is cleaned methodically to remove residue and restore a cleaner, brighter finish. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    After cleaning, the detached components are rinsed, polished and reinstalled carefully. We ensure everything fits correctly before completing the task. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    A final check is carried out, and the surrounding area is tidied. Your oven is left in a clean, ready-for-use condition.

                        <p>
                            Yes, we clean gas, electric, and combis. Each type requires special care, so we’ll explain what to expect from our cleaning service for each of them.
