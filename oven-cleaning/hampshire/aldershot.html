                        <h3>Environmentally Safe Cleaning</h3>
                        <p>
                            We take your safety and the environment seriously, which is why our approach focuses on effective cleaning without unnecessary harshness. The products used inside your home are non-toxic and biodegradable, ensuring your kitchen remains safe for you, your family, and your pets. For the removable parts placed in our heated dip tank, we use a controlled caustic solution that breaks down heavy grease and carbon build-up quickly and efficiently. After soaking, every component is fully rinsed, neutralised, and wiped down to guarantee no residue is left behind. This balanced method allows us to deliver a deep and thorough clean while still maintaining a safe and responsible process from start to finish.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Your oven refresh begins the moment you get in touch for a free, no-obligation quote based on your appliance and its condition. Once you are happy with the estimate, we arrange an appointment that suits your schedule. On the day, we give you a quick call before we arrive to keep everything running smoothly.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        When we arrive, our technician carries out a full inspection of your oven and removes all detachable parts such as racks, and doors. These are placed into our heated dip tank to break down heavy grease and burnt-on residue while we prepare the main oven for cleaning.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        With the removable parts soaking, we focus on the interior of the oven. This includes all internal surfaces. We safely remove grease, carbon build-up, and stubborn deposits to restore the oven’s efficiency and appearance.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Once everything is fully cleaned, we rinse and polish the components removed earlier and carefully reassemble your oven. We ensure each part is fitted securely and looks its best.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        To finish, we carry out a final check, wipe down the surrounding area, and leave your oven looking fresh, hygienic, and ready to use. Our goal is to give you a spotless result with no mess left behind.
