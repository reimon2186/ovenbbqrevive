                            We take your safety and the environment seriously, which is why our approach focuses on effective cleaning without unnecessary harshness. The products used inside your home are non-toxic and biodegradable, ensuring your kitchen remains safe for you, your family, and your pets. For the removable parts placed in our heated dip tank, we use a controlled caustic solution that breaks down heavy grease and carbon build-up quickly and efficiently. After soaking, every component is fully rinsed, neutralised, and wiped down to guarantee no residue is left behind. This balanced method allows us to deliver a deep and thorough clean while still maintaining a safe and responsible process from start to finish.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        Your service begins with a clear, no-obligation quote tailored to your oven type. When you approve the estimate, we arrange an appointment that suits your day. On arrival day, we call ahead to let you know we’re on the way. 
                                    </p> 
                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        At your home, our technician carries out a full inspection and removes the sections that are designed to detach. These are placed in the heated dip tank to begin breaking down general buildup as we prepare the oven interior. 
                                    </p>

                                    With the removable parts soaking, we focus on the oven interior. Each surface is cleaned methodically to remove residue and restore a cleaner, brighter finish. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    After cleaning, the detached components are rinsed, polished and reinstalled carefully. We ensure everything fits correctly before completing the task. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    A final check is carried out, and the surrounding area is tidied. Your oven is left in a clean, ready-for-use condition. 
                                </p>

                        <p> 
                            We can often arrange appointments quickly, but booking a week or two ahead gives you the widest choice of times. Short-notice bookings may also be available depending on the area. In the run up to Christmas we recommend booking earlier rather than later as we are very busy around that time.

                        <p>
                            We recommend scheduling a professional oven cleaning twice a year, depending on how much you use your oven. Regular cleaning not only maintains optimal performance and hygiene but also extends the lifespan of your oven.

                            Our dedicated team is exceptionally meticulous, ensuring that every part of your oven, including the most hard-to-reach areas like the top surfaces and hidden corners, is cleaned to perfection.
