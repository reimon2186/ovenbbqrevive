                    Keeping an oven in good condition makes day-to-day cooking far easier, and plenty of households in Basingstoke call on Oven & BBQ Revive when theirs starts to feel tired or slow to heat. Some people book in after noticing smoke or lingering smells, while others simply like having their appliance brought back to a clean, efficient state without the hassle of doing it themselves. We use safe, non-toxic products during the indoor part of the clean and work steadily through the build-up that forms over months of use. When we’re done, the oven runs more reliably and looks noticeably brighter, giving you a fresher kitchen and a smoother cooking experience.

                            <p>
                                Every household in Basingstoke uses their oven differently, so we adapt our clean to suit the type of appliance you own. Single ovens, double ovens and larger range ovens are all treated with a method that fits their layout. The aim is simple: give you an oven that feels easier to use and maintain, without you having to spend hours scrubbing it yourself.

                                Grease, fat and burnt food tend to collect in places that are hard to reach with everyday cleaning. We focus on these areas as well as the more visible sections, breaking down the residue that affects how evenly your oven heats and how it smells when in use. By working carefully through the interior, we help your appliance cook more reliably and look far fresher inside.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        Your oven refresh begins with a free, no-obligation quote tailored to your appliance. Once you’re happy with the estimate, we schedule an appointment that fits your plans. On the day, we call ahead to confirm we’re on the way and keep everything running smoothly. 
                                    </p> 
                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        When we arrive, our technician carries out a full inspection and removes the parts designed to detach. These are placed in our heated dip tank to begin breaking down residue while we prepare the main oven for the deep clean. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p> 
                                        With the removable pieces soaking, we work through the oven interior. All internal surfaces are cleaned carefully to remove buildup and restore a fresher, cleaner appearance.
                                    </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        Once everything is cleaned, we rinse and polish the detached components and reassemble the oven carefully. We ensure everything fits correctly and looks well finished. 
                                    </p> 
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        To complete the service, we perform a final check and tidy the surrounding area. Your oven is left clean, refreshed and ready to use. 
                                    </p>

                        <strong>How long does a typical clean take?</strong>
                            <p>
                                Most ovens take around one to two hours, depending on size and how much residue has built up. Range ovens can take up to four hours.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <strong>Do I need to empty the kitchen before you arrive?</strong>
                            <p>
                                No. As long as we can get to the oven easily, we handle the rest. We will also leave our working area clean and tidy after we are done.
                            </p>

                        <strong>Do you clean all kinds of ovens?</strong>
                        <p>
                            Yes, we clean gas, electric, and combis. Each type requires special care, so we’ll explain what to expect from our cleaning service for each of them. This ensures that your specific oven is treated with the appropriate methods and products to achieve the best possible results. The only brand we don´t clean are AGA style ovens.
