                        <p>
                            We take your safety and the environment seriously, which is why our approach focuses on effective cleaning without unnecessary harshness. The products used inside your home are non-toxic and biodegradable, ensuring your kitchen remains safe for you, your family, and your pets. For the removable parts placed in our heated dip tank, we use a controlled caustic solution that breaks down heavy grease and carbon build-up quickly and efficiently. After soaking, every component is fully rinsed, neutralised, and wiped down to guarantee no residue is left behind. This balanced method allows us to deliver a deep and thorough clean while still maintaining a safe and responsible process from start to finish.

                                <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        Your oven refresh begins with a free, no-obligation quote tailored to your appliance. Once you’re happy with the estimate, we schedule an appointment that fits your plans. On the day, we call ahead to confirm we’re on the way and keep everything running smoothly. 
                                    </p> 
                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        When we arrive, our technician carries out a full inspection and removes the parts designed to detach. These are placed in our heated dip tank to begin breaking down residue while we prepare the main oven for the deep clean. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        With the removable parts soaking, we focus on the interior of the oven. This includes all internal surfaces. We safely remove grease, carbon build-up, and stubborn deposits to restore the oven’s efficiency and appearance.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Once everything is fully cleaned, we rinse and polish the components removed earlier and carefully reassemble your oven. We ensure each part is fitted securely and looks its best.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        To finish, we carry out a final check, wipe down the surrounding area, and leave your oven looking fresh, hygienic, and ready to use. Our goal is to give you a spotless result with no mess left behind.
                                    </p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>How often should I have my oven professionally cleaned?</strong>
                        <p>
                            We recommend scheduling a professional oven cleaning twice a year, depending on how much you use your oven. Regular cleaning not only maintains optimal performance and hygiene but also extends the lifespan of your oven. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Do you clean all kinds of ovens?</strong>
                        <p>
                            Yes, we clean gas, electric, and combis. Each type requires special care, so we’ll explain what to expect from our cleaning service for each of them. This ensures that your specific oven is treated with the appropriate methods and products to achieve the best possible results. The only brand we don´t clean are AGA style ovens.
                        </p>

                    <li>

                            <p>
                                Most ovens take around one to two hours, depending on size and how much residue has built up. Range ovens can take up to four hours.
                            </p>
