                <p class="intro-text">
                    Keeping an oven in good condition makes day-to-day cooking far easier, and plenty of households in Bagshot call on Oven & BBQ Revive when theirs starts to feel tired or slow to heat. Some people book in after noticing smoke or lingering smells, while others simply like having their appliance brought back to a clean, efficient state without the hassle of doing it themselves. We use safe, non-toxic products during the indoor part of the clean and work steadily through the build-up that forms over months of use. When we’re done, the oven runs more reliably and looks noticeably brighter, giving you a fresher kitchen and a smoother cooking experience.

                            <h3>Tailored Oven Cleaning for Bagshot Homes</h3>
                            <p>
                                Every household in Bagshot uses their oven differently, so we adapt our clean to suit the type of appliance you own. Single ovens, double ovens and larger range ovens are all treated with a method that fits their layout. The aim is simple: give you an oven that feels easier to use and maintain, without you having to spend hours scrubbing it yourself.

                            <p>
                                Grease, fat and burnt food tend to collect in places that are hard to reach with everyday cleaning. We focus on these areas as well as the more visible sections, breaking down the residue that affects how evenly your oven heats and how it smells when in use. By working carefully through the interior, we help your appliance cook more reliably and look far fresher inside.

                                Our visits are planned to cause as little disruption as possible. We arrive within the agreed time window, protect the surrounding area and keep everything organised while we work. Once the clean is complete, we leave the space as we found it, apart from your oven, which will be noticeably cleaner and ready for your next meal.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Your oven refresh begins the moment you get in touch for a free, no-obligation quote based on your appliance and its condition. Once you are happy with the estimate, we arrange an appointment that suits your schedule. On the day, we give you a quick call before we arrive to keep everything running smoothly.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        When we arrive, our technician carries out a full inspection of your oven and removes all detachable parts such as racks, and doors. These are placed into our heated dip tank to break down heavy grease and burnt-on residue while we prepare the main oven for cleaning.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        With the removable parts soaking, we focus on the interior of the oven. This includes all internal surfaces. We safely remove grease, carbon build-up, and stubborn deposits to restore the oven’s efficiency and appearance.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Once everything is fully cleaned, we rinse and polish the components removed earlier and carefully reassemble your oven. We ensure each part is fitted securely and looks its best.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        To finish, we carry out a final check, wipe down the surrounding area, and leave your oven looking fresh, hygienic, and ready to use. Our goal is to give you a spotless result with no mess left behind.

                    Every oven we clean is treated carefully from the moment we start. Instead of focusing only on the main cavity, we work methodically through the awkward edges, upper areas and tight spaces that usually collect the most buildup. Each appliance is cleaned according to its design, so the approach always fits the model rather than following a single routine.</p>

                            <strong>How long does a typical clean take?</strong>
                            <p>
                                Most ovens take around one to two hours, depending on size and how much residue has built up. Range ovens can take up to four hours.

                            <p>
                                No. As long as we can get to the oven easily, we handle the rest. We will also leave our working area clean and tidy after we are done.

                            <p>
                                No. The products we use inside the home are low-odour and safe once the clean is complete. All chemicals used for cleaning will be neutralised prior to re-entering the house.
