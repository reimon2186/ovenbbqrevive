                        <h3>Alton Trusted BBQ Cleaning Specialists</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            At Oven & BBQ Revive, BBQ cleaning is our specialty. We’ve successfully cleaned hundreds of BBQs across Alton, working with gas, charcoal, and smoker-style grills as well as full outdoor kitchen setups. Our team follows a proven cleaning process that targets both visible grease and harder-to-reach buildup, delivering consistent results every time. Whether your BBQ requires a light refresh or a deep, restorative clean, we tailor the service to suit your equipment, usage, and schedule, ensuring it’s ready for safe and enjoyable cooking.

                        <h3>Environmentally Safe Cleaning</h3>
                        <p>
                            We take your safety and the environment seriously, which is why our approach focuses on effective cleaning without unnecessary harshness. The products used inside your home are non-toxic and biodegradable, ensuring your kitchen remains safe for you, your family, and your pets. For the removable parts placed in our heated dip tank, we use a controlled caustic solution that breaks down heavy grease and carbon build-up quickly and efficiently. After soaking, every component is fully rinsed, neutralised, and wiped down to guarantee no residue is left behind. This balanced method allows us to deliver a deep and thorough clean while still maintaining a safe and responsible process from start to finish.

                        <h3>Tailored BBQ Cleaning for Alton Homes</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Every household in Alton uses their BBQ differently, which is why our cleaning approach is never one-size-fits-all. Gas BBQs, charcoal grills, and larger outdoor cooking setups each require specific handling based on their layout and components. We adapt our methods to match the equipment in front of us, aiming to provide a BBQ that’s simpler to maintain and more reliable to cook with, without you needing to put in hours of cleaning work.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        Your BBQ cleaning service begins when you contact us for a free, no-obligation quote based on your BBQ and its condition. We confirm the details clearly so you know exactly what to expect from the service. Once agreed, we book an appointment that fits your schedule. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                    <p> 
                                        On arrival, our technician carries out a full inspection of your BBQ to assess grease buildup and its overall layout. All detachable components such as grills, burners and trays are removed carefully. The surrounding area is protected so the clean is carried out safely and neatly.
                                    </p>

                                <p> 
                                    We focus on the main body of the BBQ while removable parts are cleaned separately. Internal panels, lids and lower sections are cleaned methodically to remove grease, fat and carbon buildup. This helps restore both cleanliness and cooking performance. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    Once all parts are fully cleaned, they are rinsed and polished thoroughly. Each component is carefully reassembled with attention to correct positioning and secure fitting. We check alignment to ensure the BBQ functions properly. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    We carry out a final inspection of the BBQ and wipe down nearby areas. The workspace is left clean and tidy once the job is complete. Your BBQ is returned ready for immediate use.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Will there be strong smells after cleaning?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            No. The products we use are low-odour, and everything is neutralised before completion. Your BBQ is safe to use once the clean is finished.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <strong>How long does a typical BBQ clean take?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Most BBQs take between one and two hours, depending on size and buildup. Larger outdoor kitchens or heavily soiled units may take longer. 
                        </p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <strong>Do I need to prepare anything before you arrive?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            No. As long as we can access the BBQ, we handle everything else. We also make sure the surrounding area is left clean and tidy afterwards.
