                        <h3>Detail-Oriented Cleaning Techniques</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Our BBQ cleaning process focuses on more than just the obvious cooking surfaces. We carefully work through areas that are commonly overlooked, such as burners, drip trays, internal panels, lower cabinets, and hidden corners where grease and residue tend to collect. By addressing these details, we not only improve the overall appearance of the BBQ but also help it operate more consistently, reducing issues like uneven heat and unwanted flare-ups.

You’ll receive clear information about timing, along with a call on the day to let you know we’re on the way.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3>
                                        <p> 
                                            Your BBQ clean starts with a tailored quote based on your equipment and level of use. Once you approve the quote, we arrange a convenient appointment time. Clear confirmation is provided so everything is straightforward. 
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3> 
                                        <p> 
                                            We inspect the BBQ thoroughly and remove parts that require deeper cleaning. Preparation ensures every area is accessible and safe to clean. The setup is organised to keep the process controlled.
                                        </p>

                                <p> 
                                    We focus on the main body of the BBQ while removable parts are cleaned separately. Internal panels, lids and lower sections are cleaned methodically to remove grease, fat and carbon buildup. This helps restore both cleanliness and cooking performance. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    Once all parts are fully cleaned, they are rinsed and polished thoroughly. Each component is carefully reassembled with attention to correct positioning and secure fitting. We check alignment to ensure the BBQ functions properly. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    We carry out a final inspection of the BBQ and wipe down nearby areas. The workspace is left clean and tidy once the job is complete. Your BBQ is returned ready for immediate use. 
                                </p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Should I have my BBQ cleaned before winter?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            Yes. Cleaning before winter helps prevent hardened grease, corrosion, and unpleasant smells forming while the BBQ is not in use. 
                        </p>
                    </li> 

                    <li>
                        <strong>What makes your BBQ cleaning service stand out?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Our team focuses on the internal areas most people can’t easily access, not just the cooking surfaces. This results in a deeper clean and a BBQ that performs more reliably. 
                        </p> 
                    </li> 



                    <li> 
                        <strong>How often should I have my BBQ professionally cleaned?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            We usually recommend professional BBQ cleaning once or twice a year, depending on how frequently it’s used. Regular cleaning helps maintain better hygiene, reduce flare-ups, and keep cooking performance consistent.
