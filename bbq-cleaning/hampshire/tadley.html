                                    Each surface inside the BBQ is cleaned to remove grease and residue. This includes sections often missed during regular maintenance. The aim is consistent cleanliness throughout. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3>

                                    Cleaned components are polished and reinstalled carefully. Everything is aligned and checked before finalising. The BBQ is restored to a tidy state.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Should I have my BBQ cleaned before winter?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            Yes. Cleaning before winter helps prevent hardened grease, corrosion, and unpleasant smells forming while the BBQ is not in use. 
                        </p>
                    </li> 

                    <li> 
                        <strong>How often should I have my BBQ professionally cleaned?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            We usually recommend professional BBQ cleaning once or twice a year, depending on how frequently it’s used. Regular cleaning helps maintain better hygiene, reduce flare-ups, and keep cooking performance consistent.
                        </p> 
                    </li> 

                   <li> 
                        <strong>Can I use my BBQ straight after the clean?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Yes. Once everything has been cleaned and reassembled, your BBQ is ready to use immediately with no waiting time.
                        </p>
