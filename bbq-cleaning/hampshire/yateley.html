                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        Your BBQ cleaning service begins when you contact us for a free, no-obligation quote based on your BBQ and its condition. We confirm the details clearly so you know exactly what to expect from the service. Once agreed, we book an appointment that fits your schedule. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                    <p> 
                                        On arrival, our technician carries out a full inspection of your BBQ to assess grease buildup and its overall layout. All detachable components such as grills, burners and trays are removed carefully. The surrounding area is protected so the clean is carried out safely and neatly.
                                    </p>

                                <p> 
                                    Each surface inside the BBQ is cleaned to remove grease and residue. This includes sections often missed during regular maintenance. The aim is consistent cleanliness throughout. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    Cleaned components are polished and reinstalled carefully. Everything is aligned and checked before finalising. The BBQ is restored to a tidy state.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    A final check is completed and the area is wiped down. The BBQ is left clean and presentable. It is ready for immediate use.

                    Every BBQ we clean is treated with care from the moment we begin. Rather than focusing only on the cooking grates, we work methodically through internal sections, underside panels, and areas that commonly collect grease and carbon buildup. Each BBQ is cleaned according to its design, ensuring the approach suits the equipment rather than following a fixed routine.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Will there be strong smells after cleaning?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            No. The products we use are low-odour, and everything is neutralised before completion. Your BBQ is safe to use once the clean is finished.
                        </p>
                    </li>
 

                    <li> 
                        <strong>How often should I have my BBQ professionally cleaned?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            We usually recommend professional BBQ cleaning once or twice a year, depending on how frequently it’s used. Regular cleaning helps maintain better hygiene, reduce flare-ups, and keep cooking performance consistent.
                        </p> 
                    </li> 

                   <li> 
                        <strong>Can I use my BBQ straight after the clean?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Yes. Once everything has been cleaned and reassembled, your BBQ is ready to use immediately with no waiting time.
                        </p>
