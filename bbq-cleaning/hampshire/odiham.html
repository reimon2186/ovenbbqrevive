                                    Components are cleaned, polished and reinstalled securely. Each part is checked for correct fit before moving on. This ensures safe operation when the BBQ is used again. </p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Should I have my BBQ cleaned before winter?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            Yes. Cleaning before winter helps prevent hardened grease, corrosion, and unpleasant smells forming while the BBQ is not in use. 
                        </p>
                    </li> 

                    <li> 
                        <strong>How often should I have my BBQ professionally cleaned?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            We usually recommend professional BBQ cleaning once or twice a year, depending on how frequently it’s used. Regular cleaning helps maintain better hygiene, reduce flare-ups, and keep cooking performance consistent.
                        </p> 
                    </li> 

                    <li>
                        <strong>Do you clean all kinds of BBQs?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Yes. We clean gas, charcoal, smoker, and combination BBQs. Each type is cleaned using methods suited to its design so results are safe and effective. 
                        </p>
