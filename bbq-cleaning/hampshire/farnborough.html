                        <h3>Detail-Oriented Cleaning Techniques</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Our BBQ cleaning process focuses on more than just the obvious cooking surfaces. We carefully work through areas that are commonly overlooked, such as burners, drip trays, internal panels, lower cabinets, and hidden corners where grease and residue tend to collect. By addressing these details, we not only improve the overall appearance of the BBQ but also help it operate more consistently, reducing issues like uneven heat and unwanted flare-ups.

                        <p> 
                            We place strong importance on reliability and clear communication, as we know how frustrating vague appointments can be. From the moment your booking is confirmed, everything is kept straightforward and predictable. You’ll receive clear information about timing, along with a call on the day to let you know we’re on the way.

                        <p> 
                            Every household in Farnborough uses their BBQ differently, which is why our cleaning approach is never one-size-fits-all. Gas BBQs, charcoal grills, and larger outdoor cooking setups each require specific handling based on their layout and components. We adapt our methods to match the equipment in front of us, aiming to provide a BBQ that’s simpler to maintain and more reliable to cook with, without you needing to put in hours of cleaning work.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        Your BBQ cleaning service begins when you contact us for a free, no-obligation quote based on your BBQ and its condition. We confirm the details clearly so you know exactly what to expect from the service. Once agreed, we book an appointment that fits your schedule. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                    <p> 
                                        On arrival, our technician carries out a full inspection of your BBQ to assess grease buildup and its overall layout. All detachable components such as grills, burners and trays are removed carefully. The surrounding area is protected so the clean is carried out safely and neatly.
                                    </p>

                                <p> 
                                    Each surface inside the BBQ is cleaned to remove grease and residue. This includes sections often missed during regular maintenance. The aim is consistent cleanliness throughout. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    Cleaned components are polished and reinstalled carefully. Everything is aligned and checked before finalising. The BBQ is restored to a tidy state.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    A final check is completed and the area is wiped down. The BBQ is left clean and presentable. It is ready for immediate use.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Should I have my BBQ cleaned before winter?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            Yes. Cleaning before winter helps prevent hardened grease, corrosion, and unpleasant smells forming while the BBQ is not in use. 
                        </p>
                    </li> 

                    <li> 
                        <strong>How far in advance should I book?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            We can often arrange appointments quickly, but booking a week or two ahead gives the best choice of times. During busy periods, booking earlier is recommended. 
                        </p>
                    </li>


                    <li> 
                        <strong>Do you clean BBQs at rental properties?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Yes. We regularly clean BBQs for tenants, landlords, and managed properties. The aim is always to leave the BBQ in a presentable, inspection-ready condition.
