                                    We begin by carefully removing all detachable components, including grill plates, racks, and heat shields, and placing them in our specialized heated dip tank inside our van. This powerful soaking process breaks down stubborn grease, carbon buildup, and food residues with ease. While the parts soak, we meticulously clean the BBQ’s interior and exterior using eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning solutions, ensuring a thorough and effective deep clean.

                                <p>
                                    Once every component is spotless, we carefully reassemble your BBQ, making sure all parts are correctly aligned and securely fitted for optimal functionality. To further protect your grill, we apply a specialized polishing treatment that helps prevent rust and weather damage, leaving your BBQ looking sleek, refreshed, and ready to withstand the elements.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Before we finish, we conduct a detailed final inspection to ensure your BBQ meets our high standards of cleanliness and performance. Once satisfied, we tidy up our workspace, leaving your patio or outdoor area exactly as we found it—except now, you have a perfectly restored BBQ, ready for your next cookout.

                        <strong>How often should I have my BBQ professionally cleaned?</strong>
                        <p>
                            We recommend having your BBQ professionally cleaned at least twice a year, depending on how frequently you use it. Regular cleaning helps maintain your grill's performance, hygiene, and longevity. A deep clean before storing your BBQ for winter is particularly important to prevent rust and damage caused by grease and carbon buildup. This ensures your BBQ is in top condition and ready for use when the warmer months arrive.
