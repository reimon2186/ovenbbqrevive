                        <p> 
                            We place strong importance on reliability and clear communication, as we know how frustrating vague appointments can be. From the moment your booking is confirmed, everything is kept straightforward and predictable. You’ll receive clear information about timing, along with a call on the day to let you know we’re on the way.

                        <h3>Deep Cleaning That Targets Hidden Residue</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Grease, fat, and burnt-on food often build up in areas that aren’t reachable through everyday wiping or brushing. Our BBQ cleaning focuses on these problem areas, including internal panels, drip trays, burners, and lower sections that contribute to flare-ups and uneven heat. By breaking down and removing this hidden residue, we help restore cleaner operation, steadier cooking temperatures, and a noticeably fresher result.

                            Our BBQ cleaning service is designed to fit neatly around your day without creating unnecessary disruption. We arrive within the agreed time window, set up carefully, and keep the surrounding area organised throughout the clean. Our technicians work methodically and respectfully, treating your outdoor space with care. Once the service is complete, everything is left exactly as it was found, aside from your BBQ, which will be visibly cleaner, better organised, and ready for use straight away.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3>
                                        <p> 
                                            Your BBQ clean starts with a tailored quote based on your equipment and level of use. Once you approve the quote, we arrange a convenient appointment time. Clear confirmation is provided so everything is straightforward. 
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3> 
                                        <p> 
                                            We inspect the BBQ thoroughly and remove parts that require deeper cleaning. Preparation ensures every area is accessible and safe to clean. The setup is organised to keep the process controlled.
                                        </p>

                                <p> 
                                    We focus on the main body of the BBQ while removable parts are cleaned separately. Internal panels, lids and lower sections are cleaned methodically to remove grease, fat and carbon buildup. This helps restore both cleanliness and cooking performance. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    Once all parts are fully cleaned, they are rinsed and polished thoroughly. Each component is carefully reassembled with attention to correct positioning and secure fitting. We check alignment to ensure the BBQ functions properly. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    We carry out a final inspection of the BBQ and wipe down nearby areas. The workspace is left clean and tidy once the job is complete. Your BBQ is returned ready for immediate use. 
                                </p>

                    From compact freestanding BBQs to large outdoor kitchen installations, these are a routine part of our work. Each unit is cleaned with care so that controls, finishes, and surrounding areas remain protected. The aim is to refresh the BBQ without disrupting the way it fits into your outdoor space.

                   <li>
                        <strong>Will there be strong smells after cleaning?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            No. The products we use are low-odour, and everything is neutralised before completion. Your BBQ is safe to use once the clean is finished.
                        </p>
                    </li>


                   <li> 
                        <strong>How long does a typical BBQ clean take?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Most BBQs take between one and two hours, depending on size and buildup. Larger outdoor kitchens or heavily soiled units may take longer. 
                        </p> 
                    </li> 

                    <li> 
                        <strong>Do I need to prepare anything before you arrive?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            No. As long as we can access the BBQ, we handle everything else. We also make sure the surrounding area is left clean and tidy afterwards. 
                        </p>
