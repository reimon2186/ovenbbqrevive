                        <h3>Detail-Oriented Cleaning Techniques</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Our BBQ cleaning process focuses on more than just the obvious cooking surfaces. We carefully work through areas that are commonly overlooked, such as burners, drip trays, internal panels, lower cabinets, and hidden corners where grease and residue tend to collect. By addressing these details, we not only improve the overall appearance of the BBQ but also help it operate more consistently, reducing issues like uneven heat and unwanted flare-ups.

                        <h3>Hygiene-Focused Cleaning Standards</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Maintaining good hygiene is a key part of our BBQ cleaning service. Regular use leads to grease buildup, carbon deposits, and lingering residues that can affect both cleanliness and comfort during cooking. Our cleaning process targets these problem areas, leaving surfaces noticeably fresher and easier to maintain. The result is a BBQ that feels cleaner to use, supports safer outdoor cooking, and contributes to a more pleasant overall experience.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        Your BBQ cleaning service begins when you contact us for a free, no-obligation quote based on your BBQ and its condition. We confirm the details clearly so you know exactly what to expect from the service. Once agreed, we book an appointment that fits your schedule. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                    <p> 
                                        On arrival, our technician carries out a full inspection of your BBQ to assess grease buildup and its overall layout. All detachable components such as grills, burners and trays are removed carefully. The surrounding area is protected so the clean is carried out safely and neatly.
                                    </p>

                                <h3 class="step-3">Step 3: Deep Cleaning</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    We focus on the main body of the BBQ while removable parts are cleaned separately. Internal panels, lids and lower sections are cleaned methodically to remove grease, fat and carbon buildup. This helps restore both cleanliness and cooking performance. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    Once all parts are fully cleaned, they are rinsed and polished thoroughly. Each component is carefully reassembled with attention to correct positioning and secure fitting. We check alignment to ensure the BBQ functions properly. 
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3> 
                                <p> 
                                    We carry out a final inspection of the BBQ and wipe down nearby areas. The workspace is left clean and tidy once the job is complete. Your BBQ is returned ready for immediate use.

                        <strong>Can I use my BBQ straight after the clean?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Yes. Once everything has been cleaned and reassembled, your BBQ is ready to use immediately with no waiting time.

                        <p> 
                            Yes. We regularly clean BBQs for tenants, landlords, and managed properties. The aim is always to leave the BBQ in a presentable, inspection-ready condition.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Should I have my BBQ cleaned before winter?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            Yes. Cleaning before winter helps prevent hardened grease, corrosion, and unpleasant smells forming while the BBQ is not in use.
