                                    Upon arrival, our expert technicians carefully inspect your BBQ, identifying any areas that need extra attention, such as heavy grease buildup or rust spots. To protect your outdoor space, we lay down protective coverings on your patio or deck, ensuring a mess-free cleaning process while we work to restore your grill.

                                <p>
                                    We begin by carefully removing all detachable components, including grill plates, racks, and heat shields, and placing them in our specialized heated dip tank inside our van. This powerful soaking process breaks down stubborn grease, carbon buildup, and food residues with ease. While the parts soak, we meticulously clean the BBQ’s interior and exterior using eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning solutions, ensuring a thorough and effective deep clean.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Once every component is spotless, we carefully reassemble your BBQ, making sure all parts are correctly aligned and securely fitted for optimal functionality. To further protect your grill, we apply a specialized polishing treatment that helps prevent rust and weather damage, leaving your BBQ looking sleek, refreshed, and ready to withstand the elements.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Before we finish, we conduct a detailed final inspection to ensure your BBQ meets our high standards of cleanliness and performance. Once satisfied, we tidy up our workspace, leaving your patio or outdoor area exactly as we found it—except now, you have a perfectly restored BBQ, ready for your next cookout.

                        <strong>How often should I have my BBQ professionally cleaned?</strong>
                        <p>
                            We recommend scheduling a professional BBQ cleaning twice a year, depending on how much you use your grill. Regular cleaning not only maintains optimal performance and hygiene but also extends the lifespan of your BBQ. We especially encourage a thorough clean before putting your BBQ away for winter. Cleaning before winter prevents rust and weathering caused by accumulated carbon and grease, ensuring your BBQ is ready to go for next summer.

                            Our dedicated team is exceptionally meticulous, ensuring that every part of your BBQ—including the most hard-to-reach areas like the top surfaces and hidden corners—is cleaned to perfection. Additionally, we polish your BBQ with a special product that prevents rusting and weathering. This product forms a thin layer of oil that repels rain and prevents oxidation, protecting your BBQ from the elements and maintaining its pristine condition.

                            Yes, we clean gas, charcoal, electric, and pellet grills. Each type requires special care, so we’ll explain what to expect from our cleaning service for each of them. This ensures that your specific grill is treated with the appropriate methods and products to achieve the best possible results.
