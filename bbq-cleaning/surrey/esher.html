                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3>
                                        <p> 
                                            Your BBQ clean starts with a tailored quote based on your equipment and level of use. Once you approve the quote, we arrange a convenient appointment time. Clear confirmation is provided so everything is straightforward. 
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3> 
                                        <p> 
                                            We inspect the BBQ thoroughly and remove parts that require deeper cleaning. Preparation ensures every area is accessible and safe to clean. The setup is organised to keep the process controlled.
                                        </p>

                                <p> 
                                    All internal and external surfaces are cleaned carefully to remove buildup. Attention is given to areas that affect heat distribution and flare-ups. This stage restores a fresher cooking environment.
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3>
                                <p> 
                                    Components are cleaned, polished and reinstalled securely. Each part is checked for correct fit before moving on. This ensures safe operation when the BBQ is used again. </p> 
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p> 
                                    We inspect the BBQ once more and tidy the surrounding space. Everything is left orderly and clean. The BBQ is ready for use straight away.

                    <li> 
                        <strong>How far in advance should I book?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            We can often arrange appointments quickly, but booking a week or two ahead gives the best choice of times. During busy periods, booking earlier is recommended. 
                        </p>

                        <strong>How often should I have my BBQ professionally cleaned?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            We usually recommend professional BBQ cleaning once or twice a year, depending on how frequently it’s used. Regular cleaning helps maintain better hygiene, reduce flare-ups, and keep cooking performance consistent.

                        <p> 
                            Our team focuses on the internal areas most people can’t easily access, not just the cooking surfaces. This results in a deeper clean and a BBQ that performs more reliably.
