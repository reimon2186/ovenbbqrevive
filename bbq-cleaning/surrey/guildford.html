                    Keeping a BBQ in good condition makes outdoor cooking easier, and many households in Guildford turn to Oven & BBQ Revive when grease buildup starts affecting performance. Some book after noticing flare-ups or unpleasant smells, while others simply like having their BBQ brought back to a clean, reliable standard without dealing with the dirty work themselves. We use safe products throughout the clean and work steadily through months of accumulated residue. When we’re done, your BBQ runs more reliably and looks noticeably cleaner, giving you a fresher outdoor cooking space and a smoother grilling experience.</p>

                        <h3>Tailored BBQ Cleaning for Guildford Homes</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Every household in Guildford uses their BBQ differently, which is why our cleaning approach is never one-size-fits-all. Gas BBQs, charcoal grills, and larger outdoor cooking setups each require specific handling based on their layout and components. We adapt our methods to match the equipment in front of us, aiming to provide a BBQ that’s simpler to maintain and more reliable to cook with, without you needing to put in hours of cleaning work.    
                        </p>

                        <h3>Deep Cleaning That Targets Hidden Residue</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Grease, fat, and burnt-on food often build up in areas that aren’t reachable through everyday wiping or brushing. Our BBQ cleaning focuses on these problem areas, including internal panels, drip trays, burners, and lower sections that contribute to flare-ups and uneven heat. By breaking down and removing this hidden residue, we help restore cleaner operation, steadier cooking temperatures, and a noticeably fresher result.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        Your BBQ cleaning service begins when you contact us for a free, no-obligation quote based on your BBQ and its condition. We confirm the details clearly so you know exactly what to expect from the service. Once agreed, we book an appointment that fits your schedule. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                    <p> 
                                        On arrival, our technician carries out a full inspection of your BBQ to assess grease buildup and its overall layout. All detachable components such as grills, burners and trays are removed carefully. The surrounding area is protected so the clean is carried out safely and neatly.
                                    </p>

                                <p> 
                                    All internal and external surfaces are cleaned carefully to remove buildup. Attention is given to areas that affect heat distribution and flare-ups. This stage restores a fresher cooking environment.
                                </p> 
                                <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3>
                                <p> 
                                    Components are cleaned, polished and reinstalled securely. Each part is checked for correct fit before moving on. This ensures safe operation when the BBQ is used again. </p> 
                                <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                <p> 
                                    We inspect the BBQ once more and tidy the surrounding space. Everything is left orderly and clean. The BBQ is ready for use straight away.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Do you clean all kinds of BBQs?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Yes. We clean gas, charcoal, smoker, and combination BBQs. Each type is cleaned using methods suited to its design so results are safe and effective. 
                        </p> 
                    </li>

                   <li> 
                        <strong>How long does a typical BBQ clean take?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Most BBQs take between one and two hours, depending on size and buildup. Larger outdoor kitchens or heavily soiled units may take longer. 
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            Our team focuses on the internal areas most people can’t easily access, not just the cooking surfaces. This results in a deeper clean and a BBQ that performs more reliably.
