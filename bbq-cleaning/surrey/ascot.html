                    <div class="feature">
                        <h3>Tailored BBQ Cleaning for Ascot Homes</h3> <p> Every household in Ascot uses their BBQ differently, which is why our cleaning approach is never one-size-fits-all. Gas BBQs, charcoal grills, and larger outdoor cooking setups each require specific handling based on their layout and components. We adapt our methods to match the equipment in front of us, aiming to provide a BBQ that’s simpler to maintain and more reliable to cook with, without you needing to put in hours of cleaning work.

                        <h3>Environmentally Safe Cleaning</h3>
                        <p>
                            We take your safety and the environment seriously, which is why our approach focuses on effective cleaning without unnecessary harshness. The products used inside your home are non-toxic and biodegradable, ensuring your kitchen remains safe for you, your family, and your pets. For the removable parts placed in our heated dip tank, we use a controlled caustic solution that breaks down heavy grease and carbon build-up quickly and efficiently. After soaking, every component is fully rinsed, neutralised, and wiped down to guarantee no residue is left behind. This balanced method allows us to deliver a deep and thorough clean while still maintaining a safe and responsible process from start to finish.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3>
                                        <p> 
                                            Your BBQ clean starts with a tailored quote based on your equipment and level of use. Once you approve the quote, we arrange a convenient appointment time. Clear confirmation is provided so everything is straightforward. 
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3> 
                                        <p> 
                                            We inspect the BBQ thoroughly and remove parts that require deeper cleaning. Preparation ensures every area is accessible and safe to clean. The setup is organised to keep the process controlled.
                                        </p>

                                    <p>
                                        With the removable parts soaking, we focus on the interior of the BBQ. This includes all internal surfaces. We safely remove grease, carbon build-up, and stubborn deposits to restore the BBQ’s efficiency and appearance.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Once everything is fully cleaned, we rinse and polish the components removed earlier and carefully reassemble your BBQ. We ensure each part is fitted securely and looks its best.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        To finish, we carry out a final check, wipe down the surrounding area, and leave your BBQ looking fresh, hygienic, and ready to use. Our goal is to give you a spotless result with no mess left behind.

                    Every BBQ we clean is treated with care from the moment we begin. Rather than focusing only on the cooking grates, we work methodically through internal sections, underside panels, and areas that commonly collect grease and carbon buildup. Each BBQ is cleaned according to its design, ensuring the approach suits the equipment rather than following a fixed routine.

                        <strong>How long does a typical BBQ clean take?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Most BBQs take between one and two hours, depending on size and buildup. Larger outdoor kitchens or heavily soiled units may take longer. 
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            Our team focuses on the internal areas most people can’t easily access, not just the cooking surfaces. This results in a deeper clean and a BBQ that performs more reliably.

                        <p> 
                            Yes. We clean gas, charcoal, smoker, and combination BBQs. Each type is cleaned using methods suited to its design so results are safe and effective.
