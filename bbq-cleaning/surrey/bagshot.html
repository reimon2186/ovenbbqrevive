                <p class="intro-text">
                    Keeping a BBQ in good condition makes outdoor cooking easier, and many households in Bagshot turn to Oven & BBQ Revive when grease buildup starts affecting performance. Some book after noticing flare-ups or unpleasant smells, while others simply like having their BBQ brought back to a clean, reliable standard without dealing with the dirty work themselves. We use safe products throughout the clean and work steadily through months of accumulated residue. When we’re done, your BBQ runs more reliably and looks noticeably cleaner, giving you a fresher outdoor cooking space and a smoother grilling experience.

                        <h3>Tailored BBQ Cleaning for Bagshot Homes</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Every household in Bagshot uses their BBQ differently, which is why our cleaning approach is never one-size-fits-all. Gas BBQs, charcoal grills, and larger outdoor cooking setups each require specific handling based on their layout and components. We adapt our methods to match the equipment in front of us, aiming to provide a BBQ that’s simpler to maintain and more reliable to cook with, without you needing to put in hours of cleaning work.    
                        </p>

                        <h3>Deep Cleaning That Targets Hidden Residue</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Grease, fat, and burnt-on food often build up in areas that aren’t reachable through everyday wiping or brushing. Our BBQ cleaning focuses on these problem areas, including internal panels, drip trays, burners, and lower sections that contribute to flare-ups and uneven heat. By breaking down and removing this hidden residue, we help restore cleaner operation, steadier cooking temperatures, and a noticeably fresher result.

                                    <h3>Step 1: Booking & Coordination</h3> 
                                    <p> 
                                        The process begins with a simple enquiry and a clear quote. Once confirmed, we arrange an appointment that suits your availability. Communication is kept simple throughout. 
                                    </p> 
                                    <h3>Step 2: Inspection and Preparation</h3>
                                    <p> 
                                        We assess the BBQ and remove parts designed for deeper cleaning. Proper preparation ensures no areas are missed. The BBQ is made ready for a full clean. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        With the removable parts soaking, we focus on the interior of the BBQ. This includes all internal surfaces. We safely remove grease, carbon build-up, and stubborn deposits to restore the BBQ’s efficiency and appearance.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 4: Polishing & Reassembly</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Once everything is fully cleaned, we rinse and polish the components removed earlier and carefully reassemble your BBQ. We ensure each part is fitted securely and looks its best.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Step 5: Final Touches</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        To finish, we carry out a final check, wipe down the surrounding area, and leave your BBQ looking fresh, hygienic, and ready to use. Our goal is to give you a spotless result with no mess left behind.

                    <li> 
                        <strong>How long does a typical BBQ clean take?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Most BBQs take between one and two hours, depending on size and buildup. Larger outdoor kitchens or heavily soiled units may take longer.

                        <p> 
                            No. As long as we can access the BBQ, we handle everything else. We also make sure the surrounding area is left clean and tidy afterwards.

                            Yes. We clean gas, charcoal, smoker, and combination BBQs. Each type is cleaned using methods suited to its design so results are safe and effective.
