                <p class="intro-text">
                    Many households across Bordon contact Oven & BBQ Revive because they are tired of being told to replace equipment that still has plenty of life left in it. BBQ repairs allow you to keep using what you already own without spending a small fortune. Our service focuses on restoring proper function rather than selling you something new. With access to reliable parts suppliers, we can often replace only what is actually needed. Repairing instead of replacing helps reduce waste and keeps costs down. After the repair, the BBQ feels far more usable. It makes sense to fix what can be fixed.

                        <h3>Experienced Technicians You Can Rely On</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Our technicians are experienced in repairing a wide range of BBQ units, from compact home setups to larger multi burner models used regularly throughout the year. This experience comes from hands on repair work across many different makes and designs. We understand how BBQ components are meant to function together and how faults tend to develop over time through regular use and exposure. That knowledge allows us to diagnose issues accurately and avoid unnecessary work. Repairs are carried out carefully to restore proper operation. Our focus is always on workmanship that holds up over time and supports regular outdoor cooking.

                        <h3>Clear Explanations and Honest Advice</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            We believe customers should understand exactly what is happening with their BBQ equipment. Before any repair work begins, we explain the fault clearly and talk through what is required to fix it. There is no unnecessary technical language or vague explanations. This straightforward approach allows homeowners across Bordon to make informed decisions about their BBQ. Honest advice is always given based on what makes sense for the equipment. Clear communication is an important part of how we work and how trust is built.

                        <p> 
                            When carrying out BBQ repairs, we work in a tidy and organised manner within your outdoor space. Surrounding areas are respected, and the equipment is handled properly throughout the repair process. We focus on completing the work correctly rather than rushing through it. Tools and parts are kept organised, and the BBQ is reassembled carefully once the repair is complete. The area is left as it was found. The main difference is that your BBQ is working again and ready to be used with confidence.

                    <li> 
                        <strong>Is it worth repairing an older BBQ?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            In many cases, yes. BBQs are often replaced when a repair would restore proper function. If the structure of the BBQ is still in good condition, repairing faulty components can return it to reliable use. We assess the condition of the equipment honestly and will advise whether repair is a sensible option based on the fault and overall condition. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <strong>What happens if you do not have the part needed for my BBQ repair?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            If a specific part is required and is not immediately available, we will source it through trusted suppliers and arrange a return visit to complete the repair. You will be kept informed throughout the process so you know what to expect. You will not be charged multiple service fees for the same repair, and no work goes ahead without your approval. Our priority is completing the repair correctly using suitable components. 
                        </p> 
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        <strong>Are your BBQ repair parts and workmanship covered?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Any replacement parts fitted during a BBQ repair come with a manufacturer’s warranty where applicable. While we do not offer a separate repair guarantee, all work is carried out carefully and professionally. We also provide clear guidance on using and maintaining your BBQ after the repair to help prevent the same issue from returning.
