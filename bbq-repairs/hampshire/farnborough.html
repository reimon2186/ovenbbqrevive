                <ul class="faq-list">
                    <li> 
                        <strong>Is it worth repairing an older BBQ?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            In many cases, yes. BBQs are often replaced when a repair would restore proper function. If the structure of the BBQ is still in good condition, repairing faulty components can return it to reliable use. We assess the condition of the equipment honestly and will advise whether repair is a sensible option based on the fault and overall condition. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <strong>Do you provide quotes before carrying out the BBQ repair?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Yes. Our service fee is always £70, with the cost of any required parts discussed before any work is carried out. Once the issue has been identified, we explain what needs to be done and provide clear pricing so you can decide how to proceed. No work goes ahead without your approval, and there are no hidden charges.
                        </p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <strong>Do you offer same-day or next-day BBQ repairs?</strong> 
                        <p>
                            Appointment availability depends on current bookings and the type of issue with your BBQ. We always aim to arrange repairs as soon as reasonably possible, but timescales can vary depending on the fault and the work required. Once you get in touch, we will discuss availability and arrange a suitable visit without making rushed promises. Our focus is on carrying out the repair properly.
