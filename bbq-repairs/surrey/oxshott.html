                        <strong>Do you offer same-day or next-day BBQ repairs?</strong> 
                        <p>
                            Appointment availability depends on current bookings and the type of issue with your BBQ. We always aim to arrange repairs as soon as reasonably possible, but timescales can vary depending on the fault and the work required. Once you get in touch, we will discuss availability and arrange a suitable visit without making rushed promises. Our focus is on carrying out the repair properly. 
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            If a specific part is required and is not immediately available, we will source it through trusted suppliers and arrange a return visit to complete the repair. You will be kept informed throughout the process so you know what to expect. You will not be charged multiple service fees for the same repair, and no work goes ahead without your approval. Our priority is completing the repair correctly using suitable components.

                            We repair a wide range of BBQ issues that affect everyday use and cooking performance.
