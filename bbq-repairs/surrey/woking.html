                <p class="intro-text">
                    Oven & BBQ Revive carries out professional BBQ repairs across Woking for people who are fed up with equipment that no longer works properly. Most issues do not appear overnight, they creep in slowly after seasons of use. Our repair service focuses on getting to the bottom of what has gone wrong and fixing it properly. Too often, perfectly repairable equipment is replaced without good reason. There is no point throwing money at a brand new BBQ when the one you already own can be repaired for far less. Repairing instead of replacing also avoids adding unnecessary waste to landfill. Once repaired, your BBQ feels solid and ready to use again.

                        <h3>BBQ Repairs for Homes Across Woking</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Homes across Woking rely on their BBQ equipment in different ways, from occasional summer use to frequent cooking throughout the season. Even well looked after BBQ units can develop faults without warning. Our repair work focuses on restoring proper function so the equipment can return to normal use. We take into account how the BBQ is used within the household and address issues accordingly. The aim is to make the BBQ dependable again rather than leaving customers working around faults. This helps keep outdoor cooking setups functional across Woking.

                        <h3>Careful, Professional Repair Visits</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            When carrying out BBQ repairs, we work in a tidy and organised manner within your outdoor space. Surrounding areas are respected, and the equipment is handled properly throughout the repair process. We focus on completing the work correctly rather than rushing through it. Tools and parts are kept organised, and the BBQ is reassembled carefully once the repair is complete. The area is left as it was found. The main difference is that your BBQ is working again and ready to be used with confidence.

                <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <ul class="faq-list">
                     <li> 
                        <strong>Is it worth repairing an older BBQ?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            In many cases, yes. BBQs are often replaced when a repair would restore proper function. If the structure of the BBQ is still in good condition, repairing faulty components can return it to reliable use. We assess the condition of the equipment honestly and will advise whether repair is a sensible option based on the fault and overall condition. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                   <li> 
                        <strong>What happens if you do not have the part needed for my BBQ repair?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            If a specific part is required and is not immediately available, we will source it through trusted suppliers and arrange a return visit to complete the repair. You will be kept informed throughout the process so you know what to expect. You will not be charged multiple service fees for the same repair, and no work goes ahead without your approval. Our priority is completing the repair correctly using suitable components. 
                        </p> 
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        <strong>How long does a typical BBQ repair take?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Repair times vary depending on the fault and the complexity of the work involved. Some BBQ repairs can be completed in under an hour, while others may take a few hours if multiple components need attention. We focus on completing the repair properly rather than rushing, and we will give you a clear idea of what to expect once the issue has been assessed.
