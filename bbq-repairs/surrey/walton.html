                     <li> 
                        <strong>Is it worth repairing an older BBQ?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            In many cases, yes. BBQs are often replaced when a repair would restore proper function. If the structure of the BBQ is still in good condition, repairing faulty components can return it to reliable use. We assess the condition of the equipment honestly and will advise whether repair is a sensible option based on the fault and overall condition. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                   <li> 
                        <strong>What happens if you do not have the part needed for my BBQ repair?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            If a specific part is required and is not immediately available, we will source it through trusted suppliers and arrange a return visit to complete the repair. You will be kept informed throughout the process so you know what to expect. You will not be charged multiple service fees for the same repair, and no work goes ahead without your approval. Our priority is completing the repair correctly using suitable components. 
                        </p> 
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        <strong>Are your BBQ repair parts and workmanship covered?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Any replacement parts fitted during a BBQ repair come with a manufacturer’s warranty where applicable. While we do not offer a separate repair guarantee, all work is carried out carefully and professionally. We also provide clear guidance on using and maintaining your BBQ after the repair to help prevent the same issue from returning.
