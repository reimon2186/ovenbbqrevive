                <p class="intro-text">
                    Many households across Guildford contact Oven & BBQ Revive because they are tired of being told to replace equipment that still has plenty of life left in it. BBQ repairs allow you to keep using what you already own without spending a small fortune. Our service focuses on restoring proper function rather than selling you something new. With access to reliable parts suppliers, we can often replace only what is actually needed. Repairing instead of replacing helps reduce waste and keeps costs down. After the repair, the BBQ feels far more usable. It makes sense to fix what can be fixed.

                        <h3>Knowledge Across Major BBQ Brands</h3> 
                        <p> 
                            Our experience covers a wide range of BBQ manufacturers and designs commonly found in homes across Guildford. Over time, we have built strong knowledge of how different brands construct their BBQ units and where faults typically occur. This familiarity allows us to approach repairs with confidence and accuracy. When replacement components are required, we work with trusted parts suppliers to source suitable items. This ensures repairs are completed correctly and performance is maintained once the work is finished. It also allows us to support many different BBQ setups.

                        <p> 
                            When carrying out BBQ repairs, we work in a tidy and organised manner within your outdoor space. Surrounding areas are respected, and the equipment is handled properly throughout the repair process. We focus on completing the work correctly rather than rushing through it. Tools and parts are kept organised, and the BBQ is reassembled carefully once the repair is complete. The area is left as it was found. The main difference is that your BBQ is working again and ready to be used with confidence.

                        <p> 
                            Homes across Guildford rely on their BBQ equipment in different ways, from occasional summer use to frequent cooking throughout the season. Even well looked after BBQ units can develop faults without warning. Our repair work focuses on restoring proper function so the equipment can return to normal use. We take into account how the BBQ is used within the household and address issues accordingly. The aim is to make the BBQ dependable again rather than leaving customers working around faults. This helps keep outdoor cooking setups functional across Guildford.

                        <strong>Do you offer same-day or next-day BBQ repairs?</strong> 
                        <p>
                            Appointment availability depends on current bookings and the type of issue with your BBQ. We always aim to arrange repairs as soon as reasonably possible, but timescales can vary depending on the fault and the work required. Once you get in touch, we will discuss availability and arrange a suitable visit without making rushed promises. Our focus is on carrying out the repair properly. 
                        </p> 
                    </li>
                   <li> 
                        <strong>What happens if you do not have the part needed for my BBQ repair?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            If a specific part is required and is not immediately available, we will source it through trusted suppliers and arrange a return visit to complete the repair. You will be kept informed throughout the process so you know what to expect. You will not be charged multiple service fees for the same repair, and no work goes ahead without your approval. Our priority is completing the repair correctly using suitable components. 
                        </p>

                        <strong>How long does a typical BBQ repair take?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Repair times vary depending on the fault and the complexity of the work involved. Some BBQ repairs can be completed in under an hour, while others may take a few hours if multiple components need attention. We focus on completing the repair properly rather than rushing, and we will give you a clear idea of what to expect once the issue has been assessed.
