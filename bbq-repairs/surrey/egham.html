                <p class="intro-text">
                    When a BBQ starts letting you down, Oven & BBQ Revive offers repair services across Egham that focus on sensible solutions. A lot of people assume a fault means the end of their BBQ, but that is rarely the case. Our approach is to assess what can be repaired before suggesting anything else. Repairing an existing BBQ is usually far cheaper than buying a new one and avoids unnecessary waste. We take pride in bringing equipment back into proper working order. Once repaired, controls respond better and performance improves noticeably. It proves that repair is often the smarter option.

                     <li> 
                        <strong>What are the most common BBQ problems you fix?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            We repair a wide range of BBQ issues that affect everyday use and cooking performance. These include uneven heat, ignition problems, controls not responding properly, excessive flare ups, components not functioning as they should, and issues that affect overall operation. Each repair starts with a proper assessment so the fault is addressed at the source. 
                        </p> 
                    </li>
                   <li> 
                        <strong>Do you provide quotes before carrying out the BBQ repair?</strong> 
                        <p> 
                            Yes. Our service fee is always £70, with the cost of any required parts discussed before any work is carried out. Once the issue has been identified, we explain what needs to be done and provide clear pricing so you can decide how to proceed. No work goes ahead without your approval, and there are no hidden charges.
                        </p> 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <strong>Is it worth repairing an older BBQ?</strong>
                        <p> 
                            In many cases, yes. BBQs are often replaced when a repair would restore proper function. If the structure of the BBQ is still in good condition, repairing faulty components can return it to reliable use. We assess the condition of the equipment honestly and will advise whether repair is a sensible option based on the fault and overall condition.
