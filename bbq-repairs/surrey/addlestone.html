                <p class="intro-text">
                    BBQ repairs in Addlestone are ideal for people who do not want to waste money or throw away equipment unnecessarily. Oven & BBQ Revive regularly repairs BBQ units that others would write off too quickly. In many cases, the issue comes down to a few worn components rather than the whole setup. We believe repairing what you already have is better for your wallet and better for the environment. There is little logic in replacing a BBQ when a proper repair will restore it. Once the work is complete, the BBQ performs far better than expected. It is often a pleasant surprise for our customers.

That knowledge allows us to diagnose issues accurately and avoid unnecessary work. Repairs are carried out carefully to restore proper operation.

                            Repair times vary depending on the fault and the complexity of the work involved. Some BBQ repairs can be completed in under an hour, while others may take a few hours if multiple components need attention. We focus on completing the repair properly rather than rushing, and we will give you a clear idea of what to expect once the issue has been assessed.

                            Appointment availability depends on current bookings and the type of issue with your BBQ. We always aim to arrange repairs as soon as reasonably possible, but timescales can vary depending on the fault and the work required. Once you get in touch, we will discuss availability and arrange a suitable visit without making rushed promises. Our focus is on carrying out the repair properly.
